# Movie Time
### The app that saves you time.

Instead of wasting your time searching the web for every single cinema in your area for a specific movie, just download the app, and you have all the information you need in the palm of your hand.

With this app, you have all the movies from every cinema in the country.
All you need to do is filter by your favorite cinemas, and what movie you want to watch, and voil√†, you'll get all the info you need.

Don't want to watch the movie today? pick a different date, or maybe a different time of the day.

After you filtered the results and found what you wanted, all you need to do is click the button on the screening, and it will take you right to the page of the cinema.
Now what's left is for you to purchase the tickets, grab a bucket of popcorn and enjoy the movie.
